# about me
Hi there! My name is Shu Fay [舒斐] and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Physics at 
Columbia University, advised by 
[David Reichman](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/reichman/index.html).
My research interests lie at the intersection of condensed matter physics and
theoretical chemistry, where I seek to understand emergent phenomena in 
condensed matter by developing and applying electronic structure methods mature 
in the field of quantum chemistry. Currently, my research focuses on the 
strongly correlated{% 
    sidenote "sn-id-1" '"Correlation" refers to effects that arise 
    from interactions between particles ignored by single-particle (*e.g.* "mean-field") 
    approximations; the strongly-correlated regime is where these interactions dominate.' 
%}
electronic states discovered in moiré heterostructures, particularly the so-called 
"generalized Wigner crystal states" in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Prior to Columbia, I graduated with a B.S. in Physics from Caltech, where I worked 
on method development for electronic structure calculations with 
[Garnet Chan](https://www.chan-lab.caltech.edu) and quantum algorithms for quantum 
chemistry with [Peter Love](https://sites.google.com/view/tuftsqi?authuser=1) and
[John Preskill](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/).

I'm also an avid runner and can often be found on my *n*-th loop of Central Park{% 
    sidenote "sn-id-2" "Counter-clockwise, of course."
